# Hi there! 👋 I am Ruben Lalovski

<h3 align="left">📌 About Me</h3>
<p>
I am a passionate beginner programmer transitioning into the world of software development. My journey started in telecom engineering, where I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees. 
Now, I am deeply focused on learning Python through intensive training at SoftUni Bulgaria, along with self study through Udemy courses and various open source materials. I studied C++ during university and am currently on my way to mastering Python, as well as essential full-stack development tools including HTML, CSS, and GitHub. Furthermore, JavaScript, Django, and databases are part of my course curriculum, and by the end of the year, I aim to gain additional knowledge and proficiency in them to enhance my development skills.
